Pre-emtive BOM for Project

We'll need a battery, two step down DC-DC converters, a mic, two speakers, and amp, and a microprocessor. 

For control of some components (such as passthrough) we'll need buttons. Unsure as to how many at the moment.

For control of gain and volume we'll need potentionmeters. Ideally hooked up to dials somewhere easily accessible.
