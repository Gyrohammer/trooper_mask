Pre-emtive BOM for Project

We'll need a battery, two step down DC-DC converters, a mic, two speakers, and amp, and a microprocessor. 

For control of some components (such as passthrough) we'll need buttons. Unsure as to how many at the moment.

For control of gain and volume we'll need potentionmeters. Ideally hooked up to dials somewhere easily accessible.

Battery: Just kidding we're not gonna be using LiPo, just not worth it. Instead we'll be using a 10,000mAh powerbank that has all the protections built-in.
